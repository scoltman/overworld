pokemon meets hearthstone meets philosophy

So the concept for this game is quite nerdy, I realise that. I'm trying to build it in a way that a different bunch of assets and data would work easily well.

I was inspired by buy games like, Hearthstone, Faerie, Slay the Spire, as well as a child hood playing pokemon.

The eventual goal is a roaming/crawling rpg with monster combat similar to pokemon and a complex mechanical system inspired by games like netrunner.

It's early days, but anyone is welcome to jump on board.

I want to keep it single player for now, with the potential that people could take it an easily role their own game using this structure.

## Running it
