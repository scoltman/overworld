pokemon meets hearthstone meets philosophy

So the concept for this game is quite nerdy, I realise that. I'm trying to build it in a way that a different bunch of assets and data would work easily well.

I was inspired by buy games like, Hearthstone, Faerie, Slay the Spire, as well as a child hood playing pokemon.

The eventual goal is a roaming/crawling rpg with monster combat similar to pokemon and a complex mechanical system inspired by games like netrunner.

It's early days, but anyone is welcome to jump on board.

I want to keep it single player for now, with the potential that people could take it an easily role their own game using this structure.

image assets are temporarily taken from existentialcomics.com until I have something better.
